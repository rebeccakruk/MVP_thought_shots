if you like web fsd
or learn another backend language
or develop a mobile application
if you're working in the back-end
your front end might be
dart react native koglin?
three main things that allow you to develop (for two different onces at once)
but since then there are frameworkds 
two 
ios and android
in 2014 there was no other way, for ios need swift
since then they came up with react native ios and android
codlin is java and 
dart which is c like language or syntax but much friendlier than c
next thing Mark is going to do is to jump into mobile development; out of the three he will attempt learning dart. it's different enough than what he's familiar with, it will be the most interesting.

the long winded answer that is pick what you want to do (cotlin).

To briefly describe a stack. fs is fe, be, db and server application.

So instead of saying, so 'MERN' is mysql nodeJs is a backend framework mongo db and react

we used mean_ replaces react with

Mongo can is non-relatable
the vue stack is mevn 

just mention the components of the stack
python flask
mariadb mysql
vue for front end


HOW TO GOOGS
get rid of 'how do I' or 'what is' it's a stated
typically begin with technology, what I'm trying to do with said technology
it's good to limit the search words. concise. if you're trying to figure out how to do something. approach it like it's a topic
ie. python reverse list

and related to that, sometimes there's not enough information because the technology we're using doesn't have as much discussion online.

for instance mariadb. looking how to increase the number of connections to the mariadb 
'mariadb' connection limit increase
but there's a lot of refs to mysql, which i know is similar to mariadb

putting "" will look for the exact match in order of the thing you're looking for in ""
you can also look through a specific website. so mariadb setup/site:statoverflow.com
