presentation
bring your project to as good of a state as you can as far as features with things you can show
you want to show everybody everything that you've done with your project
in between there'll be time to order food
people talking (a lot of people talking)
after we're done that, the rest will be pretty much free for all, conversation, hanging out, that's it.
not a very long day. usually conversations go deep into the night. wrapped up the presentation part at 6:30 or 7
then the last person left at 10:30 or 11
more relaxed than usual
take that into consideration
in terms of dress code, do whatever you like, whatever you feel comfortable in

the portfolio website is one of the employability assignments that is due (it's published on canvas)
fairly basic, which is why we don't deal with it until we're done the final project
a week should be more than enough to build a portfolio website
